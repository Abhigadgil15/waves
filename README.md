This project is a Fender Kart prototype developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It integrates various microservices and features, such as real-time inventory tracking and secure payment processing.

The application utilizes Redux for efficient state management, ensuring smooth data flow and enhancing the overall performance. JWT authentication is implemented to securely manage user accounts and sessions. The system also integrates Stripe for secure payment processing, providing a seamless checkout experience for users. Additionally, it allows for dynamic product recommendations, helping to personalize the shopping experience based on user behavior and preferences.

To get started with this project, you need to set up the backend and frontend environments. First, ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system. After cloning the repository, you will set up the backend and frontend separately. The backend will interact with the database and handle business logic, while the frontend will provide the user interface for customers to interact with the system.

Once the setup is complete, both the backend and frontend servers can be started concurrently using the npm run dev command. This will allow you to interact with both the backend and frontend at the same time, providing a complete, real-time experience. The backend handles critical functions such as inventory tracking, payment processing, and user management, while the frontend displays product information, handles user interactions, and provides the interface for checkout.
